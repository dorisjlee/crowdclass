        Congratulations! You have now mastered the medium difficulty level.</br>
        In this new module, we will be learning about odd features in galaxies, including:</br>
         - what is gravitational lensing? why do we see them?</br>
         - what is a dust lane galaxy? what are their properties?</br>

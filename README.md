#### Doris Jung-Lin Lee, Joanne Lo, Moonhyok Kim, Eric Paulos 
Crowdclass is a novel method that integrates the learning of advanced scientific concepts with the crowdsourcing microtask of image classification. The system is written in Django 1.9. The Juptyer notebooks used to conduct our analysis is provided in the ``analysis`` folder. 

To start the system, run : 
  
  > python manage.py runserver

This will start up the webapp at your localhost:8080.
